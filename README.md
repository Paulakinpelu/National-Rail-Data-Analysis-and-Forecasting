# National Rail Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and forecast various aspects of National Rail operations using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information on ticket purchases, journey details, delays, and other related features. The objectives include predicting journey delays, forecasting ticket sales, and deriving insights from the dataset.

## Dataset

### Description
The dataset contains 31,653 records with the following key columns:

- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Date of Purchase**: Date when the ticket was purchased.
- **Time of Purchase**: Time when the ticket was purchased.
- **Purchase Type**: Type of purchase (e.g., Online, Station).
- **Payment Method**: Method of payment (e.g., Credit Card, Contactless).
- **Railcard**: Type of railcard used (if any).
- **Ticket Class**: Class of the ticket (e.g., Standard, First Class).
- **Ticket Type**: Type of ticket (e.g., Advance, Anytime).
- **Price**: Price of the ticket.
- **Departure Station**: Station from which the journey starts.
- **Arrival Destination**: Final destination of the journey.
- **Date of Journey**: Scheduled date of the journey.
- **Departure Time**: Scheduled departure time.
- **Arrival Time**: Scheduled arrival time.
- **Actual Arrival Time**: Actual time the train arrived.
- **Journey Status**: Status of the journey (e.g., On Time, Delayed).
- **Reason for Delay**: Reason for delay if the journey was delayed.
- **Refund Request**: Whether a refund was requested.

### File Information

- **Filename**: `railway.csv`
- **Size**: 4.3 MB
- **Number of Records**: 31,653
- **Number of Columns**: 18

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Datetime Conversion**: Convert date and time columns into proper datetime formats.
- **Missing Values**: Handle missing values, especially in columns like "Actual Arrival Time" and "Reason for Delay".
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as journey duration, day of the week, and delay status.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze ticket prices, delays, and correlations between features.
- Visualize trends and patterns over time.

### 3. Modeling

#### A. Delay Prediction (Classification)

- **Models Used**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

#### B. Ticket Sales Forecasting (Time Series Forecasting)

- **Models Used**: ARIMA, Facebook Prophet.
- **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
- Fine-tune models based on performance.

### 5. Results and Insights

- Present findings from delay prediction and sales forecasting.
- Discuss the most significant features influencing delays and sales.
