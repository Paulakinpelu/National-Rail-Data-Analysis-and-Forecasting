        "To analyze and forecast the dataset you provided for National Rail using machine learning, I will outline a detailed script that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, and forecasting. Given that I do not yet know the structure of your dataset, I will first load and inspect it to understand its contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by loading and examining the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset consists of 31,653 entries and 18 columns, with various attributes related to rail ticket purchases and journeys. Here’s a summary of the key columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Date of Purchase, Time of Purchase**: Date and time when the ticket was purchased.\n",
        "2. **Purchase Type, Payment Method**: The channel and method used for purchasing the ticket.\n",
        "3. **Railcard, Ticket Class, Ticket Type**: Information about the railcard used, class of the ticket, and the type of ticket (e.g., Advance).\n",
        "4. **Price**: The price of the ticket.\n",
        "5. **Departure Station, Arrival Destination**: Start and end stations for the journey.\n",
        "6. **Date of Journey, Departure Time, Arrival Time**: Scheduled journey dates and times.\n",
        "7. **Actual Arrival Time**: The actual time the train arrived at the destination.\n",
        "8. **Journey Status**: Indicates whether the journey was on time or delayed.\n",
        "9. **Reason for Delay**: If delayed, the reason for the delay.\n",
        "10. **Refund Request**: Whether a refund was requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps to Analyze and Forecast:\n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
        "   - Convert date and time columns to appropriate datetime formats.\n",
        "   - Handle missing values, especially in the \"Actual Arrival Time\" and \"Reason for Delay\" columns.\n",
        "   - Encode categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
        "   - Analyze the distribution of ticket prices.\n",
        "   - Examine patterns in delays (e.g., by station, time of day, etc.).\n",
        "   - Investigate correlations between different variables (e.g., class of ticket vs. likelihood of delay).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - Create new features such as \"Journey Duration,\" \"Day of the Week,\" \"Month,\" etc.\n",
        "   - Aggregate data by dates to analyze trends over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Modeling**:\n",
        "   - **Forecasting**: Use time series forecasting models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM to predict ticket sales or delays.\n",
        "   - **Classification**: Use models like Random Forest or XGBoost to predict the likelihood of a journey being delayed based on various features.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Split data into training and testing sets.\n",
        "   - Use metrics like MAE, RMSE for regression models (forecasting) and accuracy, precision, recall for classification models (delay prediction).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Prediction and Forecasting**:\n",
        "   - Forecast future ticket sales.\n",
        "   - Predict future delays based on current and historical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Script Outline\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll write the detailed script step by step, starting with data preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "It looks like there was a connection error while processing the data. I’ll re-execute the previous steps to preprocess the data, encode the categorical variables, and check for missing values. Let's continue from where we left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "It seems that the connection issue is persisting. However, I can still outline the next steps for you to continue the analysis and forecasting on your end. Here’s what you can do next:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Handling Missing Values**\n",
        "   - Examine the `missing_values` to decide on the treatment (drop, fill, etc.).\n",
        "   - For the \"Actual Arrival Time\", since it's crucial for delay analysis, you can drop rows where this is missing if necessary.\n",
